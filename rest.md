Q1. What is the structure of an HTTP request?

<METHOD> <PATH> <VERSION>
<Headers>
<Body>

- 	Why: Shows you understand the basics (method, URL, headers, body).
- 	How: In Go, you deal with http.Request which encapsulates all these parts.


Q2. What are HTTP headers and why are they important?
- 	Answer: Metadata that accompanies a request or response.
- 	Why: They control caching, authentication, content negotiation, etc.
- 	How: Examples:
- 	Authorization: Bearer <JWT> ‚Üí auth.
- 	Content-Type: application/json ‚Üí body format.
- 	Cache-Control: no-cache ‚Üí caching rules.

‚∏ª

Q3. Difference between HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2, and HTTP/3?
- 	Answer:
- 	HTTP/1.1: text-based, one request per connection (keep-alive helps).
- 	HTTP/2: binary protocol, multiplexed streams, header compression.
- 	HTTP/3: built on QUIC (UDP-based), better for mobile/unstable networks.
- 	Why: Shows awareness of modern web protocols.
- 	How: Go‚Äôs net/http natively supports HTTP/2.

‚∏ª

üîπ 2. REST API Design

Q4. What makes a good RESTful URL design?
- 	Answer: Use nouns, hierarchical structure, no verbs.
- 	Why: Makes APIs predictable and intuitive.
- 	How:
- 	‚úÖ GET /users/123/orders/456
- 	‚ùå GET /getUserOrders?id=123&orderId=456

‚∏ª

Q5. How do you design query params vs path params?
- 	Answer:
- 	Path ‚Üí identify resource (/users/123).
- 	Query ‚Üí filtering, sorting, pagination (/users?status=active&page=2).
- 	Why: Separation avoids confusion.
- 	How: REST convention = path = ‚Äúwhat,‚Äù query = ‚Äúhow.‚Äù

‚∏ª

Q6. How do you handle versioning in REST APIs?
- 	Answer:
- 	URI versioning ‚Üí /api/v1/users (most common).
- 	Header-based ‚Üí Accept: application/vnd.api.v1+json.
- 	Why: APIs evolve; versioning avoids breaking clients.
- 	How: URI versioning is simplest to maintain.

‚∏ª

Q7. How do you handle pagination in REST APIs?
- 	Answer:
- 	Offset-based ‚Üí /users?page=2&limit=20.
- 	Cursor-based ‚Üí /users?after=user123&limit=20.
- 	Why: Prevents performance issues with large datasets.
- 	How: Cursor-based is better for real-time streams.

‚∏ª

Q8. How do you design error responses in REST?
- 	Answer: Structured JSON with error code + message.
- 	Why: Clients need actionable feedback.

Q9. How do you secure REST APIs?
- 	Answer: HTTPS everywhere, JWT/OAuth2 for authentication, RBAC for authorization, input validation.
- 	Why: APIs are often exposed publicly.
- 	How: In Go ‚Üí middleware for JWT validation; store secrets in ConfigMaps/Secrets in Kubernetes.

‚∏ª

Q10. REST vs RESTful ‚Äî what‚Äôs the difference?
- 	Answer: REST is the architectural principle; RESTful means strictly following it.
- 	Why: Many APIs misuse ‚ÄúREST‚Äù while using RPC-like design.
- 	How: RESTful ‚Üí resource-based endpoints, proper HTTP verbs, stateless.

‚∏ª

üîπ 3. HTTP Methods & Status Codes

Q11. What‚Äôs idempotency and why is it important?
- 	Answer: Operation can be repeated without changing the result beyond the first call.
- 	Why: Makes retries safe.
- 	How: PUT /users/123 ‚Üí multiple calls update same user, not duplicate them.

‚∏ª

Q12. What are common status codes and their meanings?
- 	200 OK ‚Üí success.
- 	201 Created ‚Üí resource created.
- 	204 No Content ‚Üí success, no body.
- 	400 Bad Request ‚Üí invalid input.
- 	401 Unauthorized ‚Üí no/invalid token.
- 	403 Forbidden ‚Üí not allowed.
- 	404 Not Found ‚Üí resource missing.
- 	409 Conflict ‚Üí duplicate or versioning issue.
- 	429 Too Many Requests ‚Üí rate limited.
- 	500 Internal Server Error ‚Üí generic server failure.
- 	Why: Using correct status codes makes APIs easier to consume.

‚∏ª

üîπ 4. Middleware in Go

Q13. What is middleware and why do we use it?
- 	Answer: Function that runs before/after a request handler.
- 	Why: Centralizes cross-cutting concerns like logging, security, rate limiting.
- 	How: In Go ‚Üí wrap http.Handler.

‚∏ª

Q14. Common middleware in REST APIs?
- 	Logging ‚Üí track requests & response times.
- 	Authentication ‚Üí check JWT, API key.
- 	Authorization ‚Üí RBAC/ACL enforcement.
- 	Rate limiting ‚Üí prevent abuse.
- 	Request validation ‚Üí sanitize inputs.

‚∏ª

üîπ 5. REST vs gRPC

Q15. REST vs gRPC ‚Äî when do you choose one over the other?
- 	Answer: REST = human-readable, good for public APIs. gRPC = binary, faster, good for service-to-service.
- 	Why: Tradeoffs matter in architecture.
- 	How:
- 	REST ‚Üí mobile apps, browsers.
- 	gRPC ‚Üí internal microservices, low-latency APIs, streaming.

‚∏ª

Q16. What‚Äôs the difference in payloads between REST and gRPC?
- 	Answer: REST ‚Üí JSON (text-based, heavier). gRPC ‚Üí Protobuf (binary, compact, strongly typed).
- 	Why: Impacts performance & compatibility.
- 	How: REST is easier to debug, gRPC is more efficient.

‚∏ª

üîπ 6. Additional Questions (Often Asked)

Q17. What‚Äôs HATEOAS in REST?
- 	Answer: Hypermedia As The Engine Of Application State ‚Üí responses include links to next possible actions.
- 	Why: Makes APIs self-explanatory.
- 	How: Example: GET /orders/123 returns a link to /orders/123/cancel.

‚∏ª

Q18. How do you cache responses in REST APIs?
- 	Answer: Use HTTP caching headers (ETag, Cache-Control, Last-Modified).
- 	Why: Improves performance & reduces load.
- 	How: Clients revalidate cached responses before fetching.

‚∏ª

Q19. How do you handle concurrency in REST (optimistic vs pessimistic)?
- 	Answer:
- 	Optimistic ‚Üí use ETags/If-Match headers to prevent overwrites.
- 	Pessimistic ‚Üí lock resources until update is complete.
- 	Why: Prevents race conditions.
- 	How: ETag ‚Üí server returns version hash; update only if hash matches.

‚∏ª

Q20. How do you test REST APIs?
- 	Answer: Unit tests, integration tests (httptest in Go), Postman, curl, automated regression tests.
- 	Why: Reliability.
- 	How: Simulate real-world requests with test cases.

‚∏ª

üîÅ Real-time & File Handling

- 	Answer: spf13/viper (flex config), envconfig (env-first).
- 	Why: 12-factor apps; separate config from code.
- 	Gotcha: Use K8s Secrets/ASM/SSM in prod; avoid .env in production.

Q25. Graceful shutdown essentials?
- 	Answer: std context + os signals; drain, finish in-flight, close.

‚∏ª

‚ö†Ô∏è Pitfalls interviewers love (call these out)
- 	Creating a new http.Client per request ‚Üí no connection pooling, leaks.
